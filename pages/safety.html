<h3>Hazard Awareness in the Fabrication Lab</h3>
<p>The Fabrication Lab involves various hazards that require controls to ensure safety. It is crucial to remain aware of these hazards and work safely.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Common Hazards in the Lab</h3>
<p><strong>Sharp Objects:</strong> The lab contains sharp objects such as metal chips, unfinished parts, blades on machines, and machine tool bits. Cut-resistant gloves are available for use.</p>
<p><strong>Crushing / Pinching Hazards:</strong> These hazards can occur between moving machine parts, in the ways of a mill table, between a machine and a wall, or while using tools like pliers and wrenches.</p>
<p><strong>Rotating Machinery:</strong> Hazards are present in mill and drill press spindles, as well as in grinders and hand drills.</p>
<p><strong>Chemicals:</strong> Certain chemicals like lubricants, solvents, glues, and resins are used in the lab. Always check the container for warnings and read the Safety Data Sheet (SDS) for detailed information. Disposable safety gloves and other PPE are available.</p>
<p><strong>Heavy Items:</strong> Be cautious of heavy items that can fall or crush hands if lifted incorrectly. When in doubt, request assistance for a two-person lift or the use of a hoist.</p>
<p><strong>Hot Items:</strong> Hot items include recently processed parts and machines that have been in use. Wear heat-resistant PPE as needed.</p>
<p><strong>Slip Hazards:</strong> Address slip hazards, caused by dust and spills, immediately with assistance.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Safety Equipment and Dress Code</h3>
<p><strong>Safety Glasses (with side protection) / Face Shield:</strong> All individuals in the Fabrication Lab must wear safety glasses marked Z87+ whenever a subtractive machine is running or when removing 3D printed support material. These glasses provide significant eye protection against unexpected flying particles and objects.</p>
<p><strong>Hearing Protection:</strong> Hearing protection is required when the CNC Router is running.</p>
<p><strong>Personal Dress:</strong> Proper dress is essential for safety. It lessens hazards related to rotating machinery, flying chips (metal, wood, plastic), and heavy objects. Ensure your dress meets these specifications:</p>
<ul>
  <li>No loose or dangling hair, clothing, or jewelry that might get caught in rotating/moving machinery.</li>
  <li>Wear long pants to protect against sharp and hot flying chips.</li>
  <li>Use closed-toed shoes with good grip and stability to prevent slips and falls.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Optional Gloves:</strong> Cut-resistant and disposable gloves are available for specific tasks. Cut-resistant gloves are used when handling sharp objects or during cutting procedures. Disposable gloves are optional for messy or dirty processes, handling paints, glues, etc. Always consult the safety data sheet.</p>
<p><strong>No Open Food or Drink:</strong> Unsealed or uncovered food and drink are not allowed in the lab. The presence of loose metal chips and flying particles poses a risk of contamination and injury. Drinks can also create spill and slip hazards.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>OSHA Sources Supporting Safety Measures</h3>
<p>The hazard awareness and safety practices implemented in the Fabrication Lab align with applicable standards and guidance issued by Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). The following OSHA regulations support the safety measures in place:</p>
<p><strong>Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) — 29 CFR 1910 Subpart I</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>OSHA requires employers to assess workplace hazards and provide appropriate PPE to protect against risks that may cause injury or illness. PPE requirements are task- and hazard-specific and may include eye and face protection, hearing protection, gloves, protective clothing, and respiratory protection where applicable.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Machine Guarding</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>OSHA's general industry standards require machine guarding to protect users from hazards associated with moving parts, rotating components, pinch points, and points of operation. These requirements apply to fabrication equipment including CNC machines, saws, grinders, and other powered tools.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Chemical Hazards — Hazard Communication Standard (29 CFR 1910.1200)</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>OSHA's Hazard Communication Standard requires that users are informed of chemical hazards present in the workplace. Safety Data Sheets (SDS) are maintained and made accessible for hazardous materials, and users are trained on proper handling, storage, and exposure controls.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Hot Work (Welding and Plasma Cutting) — 29 CFR 1910 Subpart Q</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>OSHA standards for welding, cutting, and brazing address hazards associated with hot work, including burns, fire, radiant energy, fumes, and molten material. These standards require appropriate PPE, ventilation, fire prevention measures, and safe operating procedures for welding equipment and CNC plasma cutting systems.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Heavy Items and Material Handling</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>OSHA does not specify numeric lifting limits; however, employers are required under the General Duty Clause to address recognized hazards associated with manual material handling. The lab promotes the use of proper lifting techniques, team lifts, and mechanical assistance where appropriate to reduce the risk of musculoskeletal injury.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Slip, Trip, and Fall Hazards — 29 CFR 1910 Subpart D</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>OSHA walking-working surface standards require that floors and work areas are maintained to prevent slip, trip, and fall hazards. Good housekeeping practices and prompt cleanup of debris, liquids, and loose materials are used to reduce risk.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Clothing and Personal Items</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>OSHA requires that clothing, jewelry, or personal items that could create mechanical, thermal, or entanglement hazards be restricted as part of hazard control. Loose clothing, unsecured long hair, and dangling accessories are prohibited where they may increase risk.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Respiratory Protection — 29 CFR 1910.134</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Respirators are not required for routine SLS post-processing when PA12 powder is handled within the Fuse Sift glovebox using negative pressure and HEPA-filtered vacuum systems, in accordance with manufacturer guidance and a documented hazard assessment.</li>
  <li>Respirators (N95 or better) are required for non-routine conditions including spills, glovebox breaches, filter changes, vacuum failures, or any operation that produces visible airborne powder. When respirators are required, a task-specific respiratory protection program applies.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Please refer to the relevant OSHA standards and guidelines for more detailed information on workplace safety. Stay safe and always prioritize your health and well-being in the lab!</p>
