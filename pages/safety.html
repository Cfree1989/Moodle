<h3>Hazard Awareness in the Fabrication Lab</h3>
<p>The Fabrication Lab involves various hazards that require controls to ensure
  safety. It is crucial to remain aware of these hazards and work safely.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Common Hazards in the Lab</h3>
<p><strong>Sharp Objects</strong>: The lab contains sharp objects such as metal
  chips, unfinished parts, blades on machines, and machine tool bits.
  Cut-resistant gloves are available for use.</p>
<p><strong>Crushing / Pinching Hazards</strong>: These hazards can occur between
  moving machine parts, in the ways of a mill table, between a machine and a
  wall, or while using tools like pliers and wrenches.</p>
<p><strong>Rotating Machinery</strong>: Hazards are present in mill and drill
  press spindles, as well as in grinders and hand drills.</p>
<p><strong>Chemicals</strong>: Certain chemicals like lubricants, solvents,
  glues, and resins are used in the lab. Always check the container for warnings
  and read the Safety Data Sheet (SDS) for detailed information. Disposable
  safety gloves and other PPE are available.</p>
<p><strong>Heavy Items</strong>: Be cautious of heavy items that can fall or
  crush hands if lifted incorrectly. When in doubt, request assistance for a
  two-person lift or the use of a hoist.</p>
<p><strong>Hot Items</strong>: Hot items include recently processed parts and
  machines that have been in use. Wear heat-resistant PPE as needed.</p>
<p><strong>Slip Hazards</strong>: Address slip hazards, caused by dust and
  spills, immediately with assistance.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Safety Equipment and Dress Code</h3>
<p><strong>Safety Glasses (with side protection) / Face Shield</strong>: All
  individuals in the Fabrication Lab must wear safety glasses marked Z87+
  whenever a subtractive machine is running or when removing 3D printed support
  material. These glasses provide significant eye protection against unexpected
  flying particles and objects.</p>
<p><strong>Hearing Protection</strong>: Hearing protection is required when the
  CNC Router is running.</p>
<p><strong>Personal Dress</strong>: Proper dress is essential for safety. It
  lessens hazards related to rotating machinery, flying chips (metal, wood,
  plastic), and heavy objects. Ensure your dress meets these specifications:</p>
<ul>
  <li>No loose or dangling hair, clothing, or jewelry that might get caught in
    rotating/moving machinery.</li>
  <li>Wear long pants to protect against sharp and hot flying chips.</li>
  <li>Use closed-toed shoes with good grip and stability to prevent slips and
    falls.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Optional Gloves</strong>: Cut-resistant and disposable gloves are
  available for specific tasks. Cut-resistant gloves are used when handling
  sharp objects or during cutting procedures. Disposable gloves are optional for
  messy or dirty processes, handling paints, glues, etc. Always consult the
  safety data sheet.</p>
<p><strong>No Open Food or Drink</strong>: Unsealed or uncovered food and drink
  are not allowed in the lab. The presence of loose metal chips and flying
  particles poses a risk of contamination and injury. Drinks can also create
  spill and slip hazards.</p>
<hr>
<h3>OSHA Sources Supporting Safety Measures</h3>
<p>The information provided about hazard awareness in the Fabrication Lab aligns
  with various OSHA guidelines and standards. Here are some relevant OSHA
  sources that support the safety measures mentioned:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)</strong>: OSHA has specific
    standards for personal protective equipment, which can be found in 29 CFR
    1910 Subpart I. Employers are required to provide PPE to minimize exposure
    to hazards that cause serious workplace injuries and illnesses.</li>
  <li><strong>Machine Guarding</strong>: OSHA addresses machine guarding hazards
    in specific standards for general industry, maritime, and construction.
    These standards aim to protect workers from injuries caused by moving
    machine parts, such as crushing or pinching hazards.</li>
  <li><strong>Chemical Hazards</strong>: OSHA's Hazard Communication Standard
    (HCS), 29 CFR 1910.1200, ensures that employees are informed of the hazards
    associated with exposure to chemicals in the workplace. Employers must
    provide Safety Data Sheets (SDS) for hazardous chemicals, which contain
    information on proper handling, storage, and disposal.</li>
  <li><strong>Heavy Items</strong>: While there isn't a specific OSHA standard
    for lifting heavy items, general safety guidelines recommend using proper
    lifting techniques and seeking assistance when needed to prevent injuries.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Hot Items</strong>: OSHA's general industry standards, such as 29
    CFR 1910 Subpart Q for welding, cutting, and brazing, address the hazards
    associated with hot items and the need for appropriate PPE.</li>
  <li><strong>Slip Hazards</strong>: OSHA's general industry standards, such as
    29 CFR 1910 Subpart D for walking-working surfaces, address slip hazards and
    the need for proper housekeeping and maintenance to prevent slips, trips,
    and falls.</li>
  <li><strong>Safety Equipment and Dress Code</strong>: OSHA requires employers
    to provide appropriate PPE, including safety glasses, face shields, and
    hearing protection, depending on the specific hazards present in the
    workplace. Additionally, OSHA has guidelines for proper attire to minimize
    the risk of injury.</li>
